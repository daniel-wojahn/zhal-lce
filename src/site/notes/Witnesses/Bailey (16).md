## 1. Research notes

### 1.1.Description of manuscript

Very thick firm paper. Sheet: 365 x 45 mm, folded across middle to form two leaves, stiched into sections with green cord. 
Sections: 1) — 13 leaves; 2) – 20 leaves; 3) – 18 leaves; 4) – 20 leaves; and 5) – 13 leaves -> total 84 in all. Note that the sections do not correspond to the content.

### 1.2. Remarks
This manuscript seems to be the oldest textual witness of the *zhal lce bcu drug*. There is a date of composition (*chu lug hor zla bcu pa*) which seems to indicate the year 1583. However, neither the complete text has survived, nor does it appear to be a monolithic or 'single-cast' manuscript. The page numbers, probably added later, indicate that the first three folios (1a-3b) are missing, as the first page of the manuscript (hidden under the silk cover) is labelled page 4. Moreover, 14 pages previously left blank due to the original manuscript's binding have been written on in a different script (*tshugs ma ‘khyug*) (16a–16b3; 35b–36a; 53b–54a; 73b–74a; 84b–86b). Another hand also added the conversion table for compensation payments (81b–84a).

There are several indications that this manuscript must have been a student or research copy. While some manuscripts, such as [[Witnesses/Bell (16)\|Bell (16)]], show heavy signs of use and were produced in a handy travel size, Bailey (16) — by its size alone (36,5cm x 4,5cm) — is too impractical for quick consultation. 
There are also three glued bookmarks: \[fol. 19b], which reads *zhal lce bcu drug*, and marks the beginning of the legal text; \[fol. 29b], which reads *drug pa bzung khrag sbyor* \[?], and marks the beginning of the sixth paragraph); and \[fol. 46b], *rkun khrims* \[?], marking the beginning of either the eleventh or twelfth paragraph.
