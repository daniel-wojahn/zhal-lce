## I. Publication details & remarks

“Khrims yig chen mo dang zhal lce bcu drug sogs”. In *Khrims yig chen mo dang zhal lce bcu drug sogs*, fol.1a–65b. LTWA Ta.5.1 (13544). http://purl.bdrc.io/resource/W1LT0802. 

```ad-info
This "Collection" has been artificially created by BDRC. At the LTWA they wrapped together Ta5 13544 and T5a 13545 ([[LTWA 16-Addon]]) but these are individual manuscripts
```

 * the paper quality is very good and thick. I cannot identify clear thumb marks which would allow some speculation as to whether certain chapters have been used more often than others
 * the text is bound into five smaller books who are then held together by a dark red ribbon > due to the binding style it took more careful copying (i.e. fol.1a, 1b and 15a, 15b are on one leaf). 
→ We might therefore assume that all pages are accounted for. However, in the last book there are three pages cut off. It needs to be determined whether they got cut because the text has finished and the copyist overestimated the amount of pages needed or whether some pages were erased

>According to the librarian, there is no further information on the provenance of this manuscript. In the LTWA register, apart from the title, number of folios and shelf mark, no donor or other remarks are recorded. It appears to have come into the LTWA's possession before 8 October 1980 (some 20 entries later we find this date in the register). He suggests that it was either donated to HH the Dalai Lama or given directly to the LTWA as part of the repeated newspaper appeals for manuscript donations.

### 1.1. Textual features

- [[Witnesses/LTWA\|LTWA]] has a number of commentaries inserted into the main text. These comments are mostly "pre-planned", i.e. the copyist has deliberately left space to accommodate them. They are sometimes linked to a specific section with a dotted line, or inserted below the last line of the main text.
- There is a clear break in the formatting: folios 1b-15a each have 6 lines; 15b is left blank; 16a–48b switch to 7 lines per folio (not accounting for comments). 49a–64b switch to 8 lines per folio.
- fols. 30b, 45b, and 60b are empty.

* We find occasional pencil marks (corrections, additions, and paragraph-markers?) as well as page numbers written with a ball-pen.
