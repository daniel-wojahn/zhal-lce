## I. Publication details & remarks

* travel-sized format
* shows clear signs of wear (interestingly, there are marks of repeated thumb-flicking which indicates that the payment tables were probably consulted the most)
* it is bound in what seems three sections (although they do not correspond to the content)
* It has remarkably little errors and corrections (about 3-4 in the *zhal lce* text)
* following the tables there is a letter-writing manual that was clearly written in a different hand (sloppier, different pen/brush, more lines per folio)
* suggests standardisation since the compensation payments were probably written at the same time as the main text
