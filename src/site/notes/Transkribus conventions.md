## General guidelines

1. Transcribe what you see and be as faithful to the original text as possible
2. If you see a wrong spelling, select it and mark it with the *sic* tag
3. If there is an abbreviation, transcribe what you see, select it and mark with *abbrev* tag
4. If there is a substantial gap between two *shad*, make a double space
5. If there is a gap without dots, make a space, select it and use the *gap* tag
6. If you are done with a page, set it to ==<span style="background:#d3f8b6">final</span>==. if something is unclear or needs to be discussed, set it to ==done== instead.
